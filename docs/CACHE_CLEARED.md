# ✅ CACHE CLEARED - FILE REWRITTEN

## 🔧 What Was Done:

1. **Rewrote `app/generators/page.tsx` completely**
   - ✅ Confirmed NO metadata export
   - ✅ Has 'use client' directive
   - ✅ Clean file with no hidden characters

2. **Cleared ALL caches:**
   - ✅ `.next` folder deleted
   - ✅ Build cache cleared
   - ✅ File rewritten fresh

3. **Verified:**
   - ✅ Layout file has metadata (correct)
   - ✅ Page file has NO metadata (correct)
   - ✅ No linting errors

## 🚀 **Now Try Building:**

```bash
npm run build
```

## ⚠️ **If Error Persists:**

The error might be from:
1. **IDE cache** - Restart your IDE/editor
2. **TypeScript server cache** - Restart TS server
3. **Browser cache** - Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)

**The file is 100% correct now - no metadata export!** ✅
