========================================
  UNDERSTANDING THE "NO RESPONSE"
========================================

WHEN YOU TYPE: cd C:\Users\PC\my-app
AND PRESS ENTER...

✅ THIS IS NORMAL! The command worked!
   - No error message = Success
   - Command Prompt just shows the prompt again
   - You're now IN that directory

TO VERIFY IT WORKED:
--------------------
After running: cd C:\Users\PC\my-app

Type this and press Enter:
   cd

This will show your current directory.
You should see: C:\Users\PC\my-app


EASIEST WAY TO DEPLOY:
----------------------
1. Double-click: CHECK_AND_DEPLOY.bat
   (It will show you everything step-by-step)

OR

2. Open Command Prompt and type:
   cd C:\Users\PC\my-app
   (Press Enter - no response is OK!)
   
   Then type:
   npx vercel@latest --prod
   (Press Enter - this WILL show output)


REMEMBER:
---------
- cd command = Silent success (no output is normal)
- npx command = Will show lots of output
- If you see an error, that's when to worry!
