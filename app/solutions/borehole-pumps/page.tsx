// Comprehensive Borehole Pump Overview - 10 Detailed Paragraphs
const PUMP_OVERVIEW = [
  {
    title: "Understanding Borehole Pump Systems",
    content: `Borehole pumps are specialized water extraction systems designed to lift water from underground aquifers through drilled wells. In Kenya and East Africa, where groundwater is a primary source of water for domestic, agricultural, and industrial use, borehole pumps are essential infrastructure. Unlike surface pumps that can only lift water from shallow depths of about 7-8 meters due to atmospheric pressure limitations, borehole submersible pumps operate underwater and can push water from depths exceeding 500 meters. These pumps are critical for communities without access to municipal water, farms requiring irrigation, hotels, hospitals, and industries that need reliable water supply independent of unreliable piped systems. Understanding the different types, proper installation, and maintenance of borehole pumps is essential for anyone managing water infrastructure.`
  },
  {
    title: "How Submersible Pumps Work",
    content: `Submersible borehole pumps are marvels of engineering, designed to operate completely submerged in water at significant depths. The pump unit consists of a sealed motor at the bottom (or top in some designs) connected to a multi-stage pump above. The motor is typically a 2-pole induction motor running at 2900 RPM (50Hz), hermetically sealed with water or oil filling for cooling and lubrication. The pump section contains multiple impellers stacked in series - each stage adds pressure (head) to the water. A 10-stage pump with 10 impellers provides 10 times the pressure of a single stage. Water enters through a strainer at the bottom, flows past the motor for cooling, then through the impeller stages where each stage accelerates and pressurizes the water. The high-pressure water then travels up the rising main pipe to the surface tank or distribution system.`
  },
  {
    title: "Importance of Proper Pump Selection",
    content: `Selecting the right borehole pump is critical for efficiency, longevity, and cost-effectiveness. A pump that's too small will struggle to deliver required flow, running continuously and wearing out quickly. A pump that's too large wastes energy, can cause water hammer, and may pump the borehole dry, damaging both the pump and aquifer. Proper selection requires accurate borehole test pumping data including static water level, dynamic water level at various flow rates, recovery rate, and sustainable yield. The pump must be sized to deliver the required daily volume at a flow rate below the sustainable yield, with adequate pressure to overcome total dynamic head (TDH). Our engineers analyze all these factors to specify the optimal pump model, motor size, and number of stages for your specific borehole conditions and water requirements.`
  },
  {
    title: "The Role of Variable Frequency Drives (VFDs)",
    content: `Variable Frequency Drives have revolutionized borehole pump systems, offering benefits that far outweigh their additional cost. Traditional direct-on-line starting creates severe electrical and mechanical stress - inrush currents up to 8 times running current stress the power supply and motor windings, while the sudden start causes water hammer that damages pipes and fittings. VFDs provide soft starting that ramps up speed gradually, eliminating these problems. More importantly, VFDs enable constant pressure systems that vary pump speed to match demand, rather than cycling the pump on and off. This reduces energy consumption by 20-50% (since power varies with the cube of speed), extends pump life by eliminating frequent starts, and provides diagnostic capabilities through monitoring of current, frequency, and fault history. For borehole systems, VFDs are no longer a luxury but a best-practice requirement.`
  },
  {
    title: "Understanding Borehole Water Quality Issues",
    content: `Water quality significantly impacts pump selection and longevity. Sand and silt in the water act as abrasives that wear impellers and diffusers, reducing efficiency and eventually causing failure. Iron and manganese in groundwater can precipitate inside the pump, causing blockages and reduced performance. Hydrogen sulfide (common in deep aquifers) corrodes standard pump materials, requiring stainless steel or specialized alloys. High salinity accelerates corrosion and affects motor insulation. Before pump installation, water quality analysis should include pH, total dissolved solids (TDS), hardness, iron content, and sand test. Based on results, appropriate pump materials are specified - from standard cast iron and bronze for clean water, to 316 stainless steel, Duplex steel, or even titanium for aggressive water conditions. Proper strainer selection also prevents oversized particles from entering the pump.`
  },
  {
    title: "Borehole Pump Installation Best Practices",
    content: `Professional installation is critical for borehole pump reliability. The pump must be positioned correctly - typically 2-3 meters above the borehole screen or bottom to prevent sand ingestion, but below the dynamic (pumping) water level to ensure it remains submerged. The submersible cable must be properly sized for the motor load and cable length to prevent voltage drop exceeding 3-5%, which causes motor overheating and failure. A stainless steel safety rope is essential to secure the pump in case the rising main fails. The wellhead must be sealed with a sanitary cap to prevent contamination from surface water, vermin, or debris entering the borehole. Control panels must include overload protection, phase monitors (for 3-phase), dry-run protection, and lightning arresters to protect the significant investment in downhole equipment.`
  },
  {
    title: "Maintenance: The Key to Pump Longevity",
    content: `Regular maintenance dramatically extends borehole pump life and prevents costly emergency repairs. Monthly checks should include recording running current (compared to baseline - increasing current indicates wear or blockage), verifying flow rate and pressure (decreasing performance indicates impeller wear or declining water level), and inspecting the control panel for faults or abnormal readings. Quarterly maintenance should include megger testing the motor insulation (resistance below 2 megohms indicates water ingress), checking surge arresters, and verifying pressure tank pre-charge. Annually, a comprehensive pump performance test comparing current operation to original commissioning data identifies declining performance before failure occurs. Every 3-5 years (depending on water quality), the pump should be pulled for inspection, impeller and wear ring replacement if needed, and motor service. This preventive approach costs far less than emergency failures that can leave you without water for weeks.`
  },
  {
    title: "Common Borehole Pump Problems and Solutions",
    content: `Understanding common failure modes helps in troubleshooting and prevention. Motor failure is often preceded by increasing current draw, caused by bearing wear, winding insulation breakdown from moisture ingress, or sustained operation at low voltage. Reduced flow is usually caused by impeller wear (especially in sandy water), declining aquifer level, or a leak in the rising main. Complete loss of water output could indicate air lock in the system, a broken pump shaft, a failed check valve allowing water to drain back, or critically low water level. VFD faults like overcurrent or ground fault typically point to motor winding problems or cable damage. Many problems can be diagnosed from the surface using current measurements, pressure readings, and VFD fault codes before incurring the expense of pulling the pump. Our technicians are equipped with diagnostic tools and years of experience to quickly identify and resolve borehole pump issues.`
  },
  {
    title: "Solar-Powered Borehole Systems",
    content: `Solar borehole pumps have become increasingly popular in Kenya, especially for agricultural and livestock watering applications in off-grid locations. These systems use DC motors powered directly by solar panels, or AC motors driven by solar-compatible VFDs. The key advantage is zero fuel cost - after initial installation, the sun provides free energy for pumping. Solar systems are sized based on peak pumping requirements, local solar irradiance (Kenya averages 5-6 kWh/m² per day), and storage requirements (either elevated tank storage or battery storage for evening pumping). Solar pumps operate at variable speed based on available sunlight, with maximum output at midday. For critical applications, hybrid systems can switch to grid or generator power during cloudy periods. We design and install complete solar pumping systems including panels, mounting structures, controllers, and storage tanks, sized to meet your specific water requirements throughout the year.`
