  CORRECT WAY TO DEPLOY
========================================

PROBLEM: You tried to run two commands on one line.
Windows Command Prompt needs them SEPARATE.

SOLUTION - Choose ONE method:

METHOD 1: Double-Click (EASIEST)
---------------------------------
1. Go to: C:\Users\PC\my-app
2. Double-click: DEPLOY.bat
3. Wait for deployment


METHOD 2: Command Prompt (Step by Step)
----------------------------------------
1. Open Command Prompt
2. Type FIRST command, press Enter:
   cd C:\Users\PC\my-app

3. Wait for it to finish, then type SECOND command, press Enter:
   npx vercel@latest --prod


METHOD 3: Command Prompt (One Line with &&)
--------------------------------------------
1. Open Command Prompt
2. Type this EXACTLY (with && in the middle):
   cd C:\Users\PC\my-app && npx vercel@latest --prod

   (Note: && connects the commands)


WHAT WENT WRONG:
----------------
You typed: cd C:\Users\PC\my-app   npx vercel@latest --prod
(No && between commands, so Windows couldn't understand)

CORRECT: cd C:\Users\PC\my-app && npx vercel@latest --prod
(With && to connect them)


EASIEST SOLUTION:
-----------------
Just double-click: DEPLOY.bat
(It does everything automatically)
